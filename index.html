    What did I do when the <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQoZnU0ClN8Ay0fkWa6czGKNHUme7RaEYpvaQ&s">sun fell </a> but the <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/what-to-do-when-bored-alone-at-night"> night was still young? </a><br>

    How did I complain to a loved one about the qualms of my annoying roommate without my <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRG6ANIIcJ8lwXw4lFHc9ej11NwzMooiolz-7uOR_P40TU_BeBuKCC0iZn2db9O5X08WzM&usqp=CAU"> iPhone 13, my iPhone 8+, and before that, my iPhone 5? </a><br>

    Did I <i>seriously</i> throw on a <a href="https://cdn.lookastic.com/looks/denim-jacket-crew-neck-t-shirt-chinos-large-92560.jpg">jacket, lace up my converse high tops, and brace the summer heat to gossip with a friend? </a><br>

    I remember, I spent almost every day from when I could walk to middle school with the daughter of the mother who made <i>absolutely</i> <a href="https://redhousespice.com/pan-fried-pork-buns/">mouth-watering pan-fried pork buns </a>-- whether that be because of <a href="https://www.alamy.com/stock-photo/child-neglect-parents.html">Asian parent negligence</a> or because of the pan-fried pork buns (perhaps both), who knows -- but I was <a href="https://www.freepik.com/free-photos-vectors/happy-asian">never bored.</a><br>

    And it wasn't because we had an endless amount of <a href="https://richanddelish.com/easy-baking-recipes/">baking recipes</a> to try or <a href="https://www.kiwico.com/blog/parent-tips/pillow-fort-ideas-for-kids">pillow forts to build.</a><br><br>

    It was because of <i>you</i>, dear Internet. <br><br>

    You <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Teachers/">taught </a>the daughter of the mother who made absolutely mouth-watering pan-fried pork buns, and she taught me.<br>

    Going against curfew and secretly <a href="https://www.istockphoto.com/photos/kids-on-bed-watching-tv">huddled under blankets, </a>we would discover the <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/miss-universe-2024-winner-miss-denmark-2024-11">beauty of you.</a><br>

    While the city slept, we listened to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BKOhTVkt2xA?si=_JlDzVY_UT9FH0T3"> Pirates of the Caribbean Theme but played on two calculators,</a> watched <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=9ac0510498ee05ae&sxsrf=ADLYWIKlnuvwRO9llpxVsq0GH6qfiyQlLQ:1737074361435&q=shugo+chara&udm=2&fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J7pRxUp2pI1mXV9fBsfh39Jw_Y7pXPv6W9UjIXzt09-YEIs5ATTcnTjDJVNBp4RbjWfOwdDigA7cgGTMAUqYq-XHEDvQBj6Tl1QS1iTN88pVlmn091C3m1whg-P_znMBPc134Mo5pdLl6dOdpk_DVU2P2jhAuxqhhJeiHOdPxH_lV-0F7w&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwiM4IuiwvuKAxWuhYkEHZ-4CIQQtKgLegQIJhAB&biw=1255&bih=686&dpr=1.25">anime with a girl obsessed with an emo guy who transformed into a cat,</a> and we tamed <a href="https://minecraft.wiki/w/Cat">squarish cats with other squarish cat-lovers across the globe on Minecraft,</a> the world of not just squarish cats but also many squarish things. <br><br>

    To conclude, you are my <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/227589783/Jesus-light">savior.</a><br><br>

    Others might think regrettingly about the times when <a href="https://raisingtcks.com/2024/09/14/relearning-simplicity-enjoying-the-simple-things-in-life-and-celebrating-them/">"things were simpler,"</a> when people weren't all reduced to <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcSTl93JNeRkIep0v4ghaETNcaS2pdUEN0IVYw&s">weird social recluses.</a><br>

    But, as a <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQZhUgHSbTVAaypqbaZtbxHSYzC-mDxsdUUag&s">natural born, weird social recluse,</a> you are only a blessing. <br>

    It is Friday night. Outside my window, the <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/gcdn/-mm-/483cf23efa9a815072bc1a0af1d6a9b4364cc5c5/c=0-168-2998-1862/local/-/media/2016/05/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/635991782576955771-NGHB2PK001-D022-00448-RV2-CROP.JPG?width=660&height=373&fit=crop&format=pjpg&auto=webp">neighbor's home blinks with rainbow lights and the smell of alcohol and consistent bass and chatter.</a><br>

    Their urban <a href="https://www.urbanoutfitters.com/shop/hybrid/out-from-under-modern-love-corset?color=003&type=REGULAR&quantity=1">outfitters corsets</a> and <a href="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRNh0bIRi0dYe0Eh29Uiy4zH_3yh7WoV67how&s">sweaty button-downs</a> jump up and down, mouths open with laughter. <br><br>

    Absolutely dreadful. <br><br>

    I call my partner, turn on YouTube's playlist of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9gLrRwLFCs&ab_channel=Vagabond">soft Japanese city-pop,</a> jump into <a href="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/roiVR1PD53w/hq720.jpg?sqp=-oaymwEhCK4FEIIDSFryq4qpAxMIARUAAAAAGAElAADIQj0AgKJD&rs=AOn4CLDiI_rpOi7_3Bmb1kLjEGO7wVYCzw">farming starfruit on Stardew Valley,</a> and smile.<br><br> 

    Thank you.
